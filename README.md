## Analytics Portfolio

### Company Profile:

- Operates a diverse fleet of aircraft, ranging from small business jets to medium-sized machines.
- Focuses on providing high-quality air transportation services.
- Prioritizes safety, comfort, and convenience for passengers.

### Challenges:

- Stricter environmental regulations.
- Higher flight taxes.
- Increased interest rates.
- Rising fuel prices.
- Tight labor market leading to increased labor costs.

### Business Objective:

- Address the pressure on profitability.
- Analyze the database to find ways to increase the occupancy rate.
- Aim to boost the average profit earned per seat.
- Aircraft Analysis:

The fleet includes six aircraft with over 100 seats, ranging from 116 to 402 seats (Table 1).

### Booking and Revenue Trends:

- Ticket bookings gradually increased from June 22nd to July 7th, followed by stability until August, with a peak in bookings. Revenue trends closely mirror this pattern.

### Fare Comparison:

A bar graph compares average business, economy, and comfort fare costs. Comfort class is exclusive to the 773 aircraft, while CN1 and CR2 offer only economy. Business class consistently has higher fares across all aircraft.

## Occupancy Rate Analysis
### Revenue Insights:

- Analyzing total revenue and average revenue per ticket helps identify the most profitable aircraft and routes. Figure 4 shows that the SU9 aircraft generates the highest revenue, likely due to its lower business and economy class fares. In contrast, the CN1 aircraft has the lowest revenue, possibly due to offering only low-cost economy fares.
Occupancy Rate:

Figure 5 highlights the average booked seats per aircraft, with the occupancy rate calculated by dividing booked seats by total seats. Higher occupancy indicates better seat utilization.

### Impact of Increasing Occupancy:

A 10% increase in occupancy across all aircraft could significantly boost annual revenue. Optimizing pricing strategies is crucial for achieving higher occupancy and profitability.

- To boost profitability, airlines should focus on key metrics like annual revenue, average ticket revenue, and occupancy rates. Raising occupancy increases revenue and cuts costs, but pricing must be balanced—neither too high nor too low—based on aircraft conditions. While optimizing, airlines must also prioritize customer satisfaction and safety. A data-driven approach to these factors ensures long-term success.
