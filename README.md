# Airlines Data Analysis

## Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing an airline’s occupancy rates, revenue, and pricing strategies to identify opportunities for enhancing profitability. Given the challenges of stricter environmental regulations, higher flight taxes, and a tight labor market, the goal is to uncover insights that can help optimize operations, pricing, and customer satisfaction.

## Objectives
#### Revenue Analysis 
Evaluate total revenue per year and average revenue per ticket for each aircraft.
#### Occupancy Rate Analysis
Assess the average occupancy rates across various aircraft and identify areas for potential improvement.
#### Pricing Strategy Optimization 
Provide recommendations for pricing adjustments based on aircraft conditions, facilities, and market demand.
#### Profitability Improvement
Explore the impact of increasing occupancy rates by 10% to project potential gains in profitability.
## Data
The analysis is based on a dataset containing various attributes such as aircraft code, number of seats, ticket prices, revenue, and booking trends. Key metrics such as total revenue per aircraft, average revenue per ticket, and occupancy rates are calculated to gain insights into the airline's operational efficiency.

## Tools and Techniques Used
#### Python
Used for data cleaning, processing, and analysis.
#### SQL
Utilized for querying and managing the dataset, focusing on revenue and occupancy metrics.
#### Data Visualization
Basic visualizations created using Python libraries such as Matplotlib or Seaborn to display trends in revenue, occupancy rates, and pricing scenarios.

Here is a concise summary of the findings based on the analysis of the airline’s data for your GitHub README:

## Key Findings
### Occupancy Rate and Revenue:

SU9 aircraft recorded the highest total revenue, significantly driven by lower ticket prices, which increased its occupancy rate. Despite having lower average fare prices, the aircraft’s profitability was enhanced due to higher ticket sales.
CN1 aircraft had the lowest total revenue, offering only economy class at a meager price. This may be due to the aircraft's conditions, leading to a poor occupancy rate.

### Pricing Strategy Impact:

The analysis of aircraft with more than 100 seats showed varying seating capacities, with 773 having the largest capacity of 402 seats. However, despite its size, price adjustments are critical as its high fare pricing could affect occupancy rates.
A 10% increase in occupancy rates was projected to substantially raise total revenue across the fleet, emphasizing the potential financial benefits of optimizing pricing strategies.

### Fare Class Insights:

Across all aircraft, business class fares were consistently higher, with 773 offering the highest fares. The SU9 aircraft, despite having the lowest business and economy class prices, showed the strongest revenue performance, suggesting that competitive pricing drives higher occupancy and total revenue.
## Future Work
Incorporate more sophisticated models to predict occupancy rates based on historical data.
Explore additional datasets for a broader analysis of industry trends.
