# Airlines Data Analysis

## Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing an airlineâ€™s occupancy rates, revenue, and pricing strategies to identify opportunities for enhancing profitability. Given the challenges of stricter environmental regulations, higher flight taxes, and a tight labor market, the goal is to uncover insights that can help optimize operations, pricing, and customer satisfaction.

## Objectives
#### Revenue Analysis 
Evaluate total revenue per year and average revenue per ticket for each aircraft.
#### Occupancy Rate Analysis
Assess the average occupancy rates across various aircraft and identify areas for potential improvement.
#### Pricing Strategy Optimization 
Provide recommendations for pricing adjustments based on aircraft conditions, facilities, and market demand.
#### Profitability Improvement
Explore the impact of increasing occupancy rates by 10% to project potential gains in profitability.
## Data
The analysis is based on a dataset containing various attributes such as aircraft code, number of seats, ticket prices, revenue, and booking trends. Key metrics such as total revenue per aircraft, average revenue per ticket, and occupancy rates are calculated to gain insights into the airline's operational efficiency.

## Tools and Techniques Used
#### Python
Used for data cleaning, processing, and analysis.
#### SQL
Utilized for querying and managing the dataset, focusing on revenue and occupancy metrics.
#### Data Visualization
Basic visualizations created using Python libraries such as Matplotlib or Seaborn to display trends in revenue, occupancy rates, and pricing scenarios.
## Results
The analysis provided actionable insights to help the airline refine its operations, adjust pricing strategies, and ultimately achieve higher profitability while ensuring customer satisfaction and safety.

## Future Work
Incorporate more sophisticated models to predict occupancy rates based on historical data.
Explore additional datasets for a broader analysis of industry trends.
